Title: Picly ($SNAP) — Cute & Flashy Website Specification

Theme & Tone:
A vibrant, cheerful, photogenic universe celebrating memes, market moments, and froggy snapshots.
Visual style must follow the inspiration images: lots of color, smooth glow, soft outlines, emoji reactions, anime sparkles.
Absolutely rich in animations and playful effects.

Main Structure:
1. **Homepage**
   - Fullscreen banner with animated logo ($SNAP) and hero image of the frog holding a camera.

   - Cute motion text effects (bounce, light trails).
   - Button: “JOIN TELEGRAM” — glowing, bouncy hover state.
   - Subtext: “LAUNCHING ON PUMP.FUN — XX MAY”
   - Animated stars/sparkles falling on scroll.

2. **Animated Story Reel (new section idea!)**
   - Horizontally scrollable comic strip of 5+ story panels.
   - Each panel: short story (130+ words) in a meme-frog universe.
   - All stories must have animated illustrations, buttons to react (😍😂😱📸).
   - Example story themes:
     - Frogs catching rugs with cameras.
     - Sad clown traders being caught mid-buy.
     - “Snap before you buy!” moral tale.

3. **Gallery of Snapshots**
   - Image carousel + Polaroid drop effect.
   - Clicking a photo reveals meme context.
   - Hover effects: lens distortion, color filters.

4. **Interactive Tools**
   - “Rug Alert!” — When clicked, displays a random fake coin and gives it a "Snap Rating".
   - “$SNAP Meter” — Live animation of how many rugs got caught today (number counting effect).
